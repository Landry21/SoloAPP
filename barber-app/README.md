## Public-Facing Professional Profile

### Overview
A new public-facing professional profile page is available at `/public-barber/:id`. This page displays a read-only version of a professional's profile, including their information, portfolio, and reviews, but omits all admin and edit features. It uses the same layout and CSS as the private profile for a consistent look.

### Route Security
- **`/public-barber/:id`** - Public access, read-only profile for clients
- **`/barber-profile/:id`** - Protected route, requires authentication, includes admin features

### Usage
- Users can access a professional's public profile by clicking a professional header in search results.
- The public profile shows:
  - Professional's name, experience, location, services, price range, and average rating
  - Portfolio (read-only)
  - Client reviews (read-only)
  - Call and booking buttons for client interaction
  - Ability to leave reviews (if authenticated and not the professional owner)
- No edit, post, settings, or admin actions are available on this page.
- The private profile route is now secured and only accessible to authenticated users.

### Testing Instructions
1. Search for professionals using the search screen.
2. Click a professional's header in the results.
3. Confirm you are navigated to `/public-barber/:id` and see a read-only profile.
4. Verify that call and booking buttons are present and functional.
5. Test the review functionality (if authenticated).
6. Confirm that no admin or edit buttons are present.
7. Confirm the layout and styling match the private profile.
8. Test that accessing `/barber-profile/:id` directly redirects to login if not authenticated.

### Why This Works
- **Client-Focused:** The public profile includes essential client interaction features (call, book, review) while omitting admin features.
- **Security:** The private profile route now requires authentication, preventing unauthorized access to admin features.
- **Consistency:** By reusing the same CSS and layout, the user experience remains familiar and visually cohesive.
- **Minimal Change:** Only the necessary navigation and route logic were updated, with no impact on private/admin flows.
